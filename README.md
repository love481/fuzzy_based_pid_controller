# fuzzy_based_pid_controller
This is the simple implementation of self-tuning-fuzzy-pid based on mamdani approach which uses the set of fuzzy rules to update the control parameters based on the input 
and setpoint given to the controller.This controller is basically built for tuning the response of motor using encoder data.U can integrate it into any system to get the reuired output as expected.
